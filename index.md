# John's Pandemic Amusements 
#### Or how I occupied my days of social isolation
On March 19,2020,
California Department of Public Health ordered "all individuals living in the State of
California to stay home or at their place of residence except as needed to
maintain continuity of operations of the federal critical infrastructure sectors ...",
[pdf](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.19.20-attested-EO-N-33-20-COVID-19-HEALTH-ORDER.pdf).
Around the same time, I discovered that the New York Times had developed several data bases documenting the
course of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States. The NYT updates these data continuously and make them
freely available ![online](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).
I offer thanks and praise to the New York Times and the folks who maintain ![github](https://github.com/) for 
these vital public services.

So what else could I do? I started to apply my fish population modeling experience to modeling the spread of Covid-19.
I also wanted to improve my ![python](https://www.python.org/) programming chops.
